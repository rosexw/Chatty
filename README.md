Chatty App
=====================

This is a Lighthouse Week 5 React project.

Many of the web applications that you use today have real-time functionality where the user does not have to reload the page in order to see updates. Major examples of these include Slack, Twitter and Facebook.

Chatty allows users to communicate with each other without having to register accounts. It will use React, a popular front-end library. It will also use WebSockets, an advanced technology that makes it possible to open an interactive communication session between the user's browser and a server. With this API, you can send messages to a server and receive event-driven responses without having to poll the server for a reply.

### Usage

Install the dependencies and start the server.

```
npm install
npm start
open http://localhost:3000
```
